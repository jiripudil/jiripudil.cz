# jiripudil.cz

This repository hosts the whole application running at http://jiripudil.cz as my website. I try to keep up with current trends in web app development using Nette, Doctrine, various Kdyby packages, NPM, Bower, Gulp, and many more. I decided to open-source it so that it can be not only a website or a sandbox, but also a learning material for newcomers to Nette. Licensed under the New BSD license (see LICENSE).
