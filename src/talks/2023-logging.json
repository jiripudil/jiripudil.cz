	"annotation": "Production is a magical place. People go there and do things, and sometimes, despite the best-typed and tested code, a bug slips through – and it's likely to be all the more bizarre the higher the quality of your code. In such moments, it's invaluable to have a place to find everything that might be relevant to the situation. This talk shows in theory and in practice how to approach logging so that you have perfect oversight of production and no such bug remains an unsolved mystery. Co-presented with <a href=\"https://cz.linkedin.com/in/marek-humpolik\">Marek Humpolík</a>.",
