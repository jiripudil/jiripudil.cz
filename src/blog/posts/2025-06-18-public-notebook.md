perex: In the overwhelming quantities of content produced on the Internet each day, I sometimes stumble upon something noteworthy. From this point forward, I am going to take notes in public.

Recently, as I was leaving home for a meetup, my girlfriend remarked that she envies our (software development) community for the way we share our wisdom and experience among ourselves. Until then, I hadn't realized it was not so common in other fields, and I consider myself lucky to be part of such a community.

But the endless stream of meetups, conference talks, podcasts, videos, blog posts and other content also puts a strain on one's ability to process all the information. Often I stumble upon an interesting link on social media or in a newsletter, but the blog post is too long a read for that particular moment. Or I have time to read it and find the information valuable, but not relevant at that point.

I've had a (lack of a) system in place for this: I would keep the browser tabs open – three different sets of tabs on three different devices – in case I might want to revisit the content later – which I seldom would. Maybe you can relate.

Then, a few days ago, one stray link on Bluesky led me to Jim Nielsen's blog. I've poked around and found [this page](https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/) where Jim shares the content of others and comments on that. And I've fallen in love with the idea.

It's like a repost on a social media, but with a few _very_ important distinctions:

**It's much more thoughtful.** It allows you to engage with the content in a more meaningful way than clicking the repost button. You can add value to the original content by sharing your thoughts. I know you can comment on the social media, but that leads me to the next point:

**It's much less interactive.** The goal here is not to spark discussion – or at least not a quick-fire discussion where you have to condense your thoughts into a few hundred characters. The goal, as I see it, is to promote quality content of others, and optionally add your two cents to it. The goal is to have a more lasting effect, which leads me to:

**It's far less ephemeral.** Relevance it short-lived on social media. Any content, however thought-provoking, is gone within the hour, along with any quality discussion. The format of a public notebook lasts much longer. I particularly like this permanence of it, because it allows it to serve a broader purpose than just a curated list of links:

Far too often I want to get back to something I remember having read months ago, and I'm having trouble finding the content. Having a notebook in the first place makes this easier, but with a notebook _annotated with my thoughts_, it should be a piece of cake. I rarely remember the title or the exact words of the post I'm looking for, but I usually recall its sentiment and the impression it left on me, so I reckon being able to search through _both_ might help.

I've decided to give this a go and start [keeping a public notebook](/notes) of interesting and relevant content I find on the Internet – a notebook that promotes sharing, discoverability, and permanence. See you there.
