There used to be a time when Sass was priceless. It has been my go-to choice as well, and it has been so for ages. But CSS has come a long way – it now has custom properties, supports nesting, and will likely get conditions, functions, and even mixins soon. And it lives in a mature ecosystem with features such as CSS modules that help with code organization.

I wholeheartedly agree with Jeff's conclusion there:

I wouldn't blindly jump into rewriting an existing, sizeable codebase from Sass to CSS. But for projects on the smaller side, and definitely for new projects, I believe CSS is already more than capable.
